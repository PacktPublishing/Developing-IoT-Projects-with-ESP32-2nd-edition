            HomeKit does not recommend having the setup code programmed in the accessory as is.
            Instead, it expects setup info (salt-verifier pair) generated for the given setup code.
            Use this option only for testing purposes. For production, the setup info should be
            used.

            GPIO number on which the "Boot" button is connected. This is generally used
            by the application for custom operations like toggling states, resetting to defaults, etc.

    config EXAMPLE_OUTPUT_GPIO
        int "Output GPIO"

        help
            This is an output GPIO that will be connected to a relay or other driver circuit in most cases.
            If the power changes, this GPIO output level will also change.
