            GPIO number on which the "Boot" button is connected. This is generally used
            by the application for custom operations like toggling states, resetting to defaults, etc.

    config EXAMPLE_ENABLE_TEST_NOTIFICATIONS
        bool "Test Notifications"

        help
            Enable this option to test mobile push notifications. When enabled, turning on the switch using
            push button will trigger a parameter notification {"Switch":{"Power":true}} and turning off will
            trigger an alert "Switch was turned off".

    config EXAMPLE_OUTPUT_GPIO
        int "Output GPIO"
        default 19
        help
            This is an output GPIO that will be connected to a relay or other driver circuit in most cases.
            If the power changes, this GPIO output level will also change.
