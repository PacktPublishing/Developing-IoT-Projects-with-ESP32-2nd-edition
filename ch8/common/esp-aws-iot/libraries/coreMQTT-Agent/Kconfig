            This can be set to any positive integer up to SIZE_MAX.
            The maximum number of pending acknowledgments to track for a single connection.
            The MQTT agent tracks MQTT commands (such as PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE) that are still 
            waiting to be acknowledged. MQTT_AGENT_MAX_OUTSTANDING_ACKS set the maximum number 
            of acknowledgments that can be outstanding at any one time. The higher this number 
            is the greater the agent's RAM consumption will be.

    config MQTT_AGENT_MAX_EVENT_QUEUE_WAIT_TIME
        int "Max Event Queue Wait Time Milliseconds"

        help
            Time in milliseconds that the MQTT agent task will wait in the Blocked state 
            (so not using any CPU time) for a command to arrive in its command queue before 
            exiting the blocked state so it can call MQTT_ProcessLoop().
            It is important that MQTT_ProcessLoop() is called often if there is known MQTT 
            traffic, but calling it too often can take processing time away from lower priority 
            tasks and waste CPU time and power.
