/**
 * Design notes
 *
 * - There is a distinct event for playing -> playing state transitions.
 * COMPLETED_PLAYING_NEXT is helpful for users of the audio player to know
 * the difference between playing and transitioning to another audio file
 * vs. detecting that the audio file transitioned by looking at
 * events indicating IDLE and then PLAYING within a short period of time.
 *
 * State machine diagram
 *
 * cb is the callback function registered with audio_player_callback_register()
 *
 *             cb(PLAYING)                     cb(PLAYING)
