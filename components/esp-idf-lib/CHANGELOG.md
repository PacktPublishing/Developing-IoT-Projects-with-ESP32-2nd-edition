## v.0.8.3

### Changes that break compatibility 
- âš  (bh1900nux, max31725, mcp23008, mcp23x17, mcp342x, mcp4725, pca9557, pcf8574, pcf8575, qmc5883l, sht3x, tca9548, tca95x5): The order of the arguments in `xxx_init_desc()` functions has been changed to bring all drivers to a common standard: instead of `xxx_init_desc(..., i2c_port_t port, uint8_t addr, ...)`, now `xxx_init_desc(..., uint8_t addr, i2c_port_t port, ...)`. Attention: both arguments are ints, so compiler will not throw an error when building your firmware without changing it!

- (examples) Added README to all examples
- (hx711) Added function to read average data
- (bh1900nux) Added software reset function
