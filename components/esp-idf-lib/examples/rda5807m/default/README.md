# Example for `rda5807m` driver

## What it does

The example configures a `rda5807m` device. In a loop, it seeks a station
until it finds one. In another task, the state of the chip is continuously
shown.

## Wiring

Connect `SCL` and `SDA` pins to the following pins with appropriate pull-up
resistors.

| Name | Description | Defaults |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_I2C_MASTER_SCL` | GPIO number for `SCL` | "5" for `esp8266`, "6" for `esp32c3`, "19" for `esp32`, `esp32s2`, and `esp32s3` |
| `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_I2C_MASTER_SDA` | GPIO number for `SDA` | "4" for `esp8266`, "5" for `esp32c3`, "18" for `esp32`, `esp32s2`, and `esp32s3` |
