            RTC data store is divided into two parts to store critical and non-critical data.
            This option configures the total size of data store.
            NOTE: On ESP32 devices, from esp-idf release v4.3 and onwards we can use all 8K RTC memory,
            so max range is specified as 7K. On releases before v4.3 we can only access maximum 4K RTC memory and
            RTC store uses few bytes for its operation so default for ESP32 is set to 3K.

    config RTC_STORE_CRITICAL_DATA_SIZE
        int "Size of critical data store"
        default 2048 if IDF_TARGET_ESP32

        range 512 RTC_STORE_DATA_SIZE
        help
            This option configures the size of critical data buffer and remaining is used for
            non critical data buffer.

    config RTC_STORE_REPORTING_WATERMARK_PERCENT
        int "Reporting watermark percentage"
        range 50 90
        default 80
        help
            RTC store has facility to post an event when buffer is filled to a configured level.
            This option configures the reporting watermark for critical and non critical data.
